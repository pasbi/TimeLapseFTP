# TimeLapseFTP
Android app capturing an image every x seconds and uploading it to an FTP server.

This app is very simplistic.
It shows a preview and three buttons:
- Capture: Capture an image immediately and upload it
- Start: Start a repeating capture every X seconds
- Stop: Stop a repeating capture

Every other configuration must be done in the code:
- upload URL
- username, password
- delay (in seconds)
